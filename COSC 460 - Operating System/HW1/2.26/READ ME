Hello! The input file and output file name are to be passed as string arguments when executing the .java file in Terminal. I don't know if you had wanted an extensive instruction to executing / using the program like you usually do even though I know you know this by heart, well here it is anyway:

In Terminal or cmd line:

1. Go to the address of the folder where the .java file is located.
2. Type, javac ByteCopy.java
3. After a few miliseconds it compiles...
4. Type, java ByteCopy [input file here] [output file name here]
5. See the program in action
6. The output file defaults to the folder where the .java file is.

Cheers
