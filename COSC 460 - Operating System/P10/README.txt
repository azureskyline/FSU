README.txt

If you're wondering why I didn't do OPT, I needed dedicate time to another subject. Not that I don't like your subject.
Just saying. But hey, nice post-mortem right? RIGHT?

Anyway to run this jar:

java -jar AustriaCatherinePageReplacement.jar [ENTER length of the page references] [ENTER NUMER OF FRAMES]

E.G. java -jar AustriaCatherinePageReplacement.jar 10 3

FOR
10 : pages
3: frames

For clarity sake and because I was told to indicate so.
Good Luck grading.
Cheers!
